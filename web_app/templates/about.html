    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <p>As Georgetown University students, we are working hard and sometimes lose track of time. 
        Or we know that we got a big project or exam the next day and that calls for some late nights.
        We created this app so that students can easily find what's open late and plan to grab food based on what they are craving!
        
        <hr>
            We fetch data using the Yelp API
